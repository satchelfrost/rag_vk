# rag_vk (header-only-ish vulkan abstraction)
The goal of `rag_vk` is to try and be as close to an stb-style header-only library as possible.

## Purpose
Currently, that goal is not being met, however because I've been reusing this file in several of
my projects, I'm starting to lose track of the various versions. This repo serves as a place where I can
at least point to different versions of the file.
